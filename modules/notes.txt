-> To import a module, use 'require' (synchronous I/O)
    - Because it's synchronous, it should be used only when application starts.
    - It Blocks Node from doing anything until the call has finished.
    - Omitting the '.js' extension, Node will also looks for '.json' files. 

-> Order in which Node looks for files:
    1) Core Modules
    2) node_modules in Current Directory 
    3) node_modules in Parent Directory

-> 'exports' and 'module.exports' are different
    - 'exports' = exports only one variable or function
        - 'exports.MyFunc' = 'module.exports.MyFunc'
        - Global reference to 'module.exports'
        - When 'exports' is assigned to anything else, the global reference is lost.
    - 'module.exports' = It exports a set of functions (Class)

-> NODE_PATH: Alternative path to 'node_modules'

-> Module directory is defined by a file called 'index.js' or by the 'main' field in 'package.json' file.

-> If two files in an application require the same module, the first require will store the data returned 
in application memory, so the second required won't need to access and evaluate the module's source files.
