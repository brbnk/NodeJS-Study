--> Backend frameworks with NodeJS
--> Koa, hapi, Sails.js, DerbyJS, Flatiron, and LoopBack

=== Koa: HTTP server library (http://koajs.com/) ===
    -- Based on Express, but uses ES2015 generator syntax to define middlewares.
    -- It needs a middleware router, so it means that a typical workflow requires planning (e.g "koa-router" module).
    -- Koa doesn't come with the tools necessary to make RESTful APIs without implementing some kind of route-handling middleware.
    -- Koa's main advantage is that it's streamlined yet has some excellent third-party modules.

=== Kraken: HTTP server library (https://github.com/krakenjs/lusca) ===
    -- Kraken’s Yeoman generator

=== Hapi: HTTP Server Framework (http://hapijs.com/api) ===
    -- Server framework that focuses on web API development
    -- It doesn't come with any client-side support or database model layer.
    -- High-level server container abstraction, security headers.
    -- hapi’s plugin API is one of the biggest advantages of using hapi.
    -- Disavantages: It's minimal, so there's no guidance on project structure.

=== Sails.js: MVC framework === 
    -- Comes with Object Relational Mappings (ORM)
    -- Front-end agnositc

=== DerbyJS: Full­stack framework ===
    -- It depends on MongoDB and Redis
