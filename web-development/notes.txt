--> How to start projects with Webpack and Gulp
--> Testing and deployment

--> Tricks in "package.json" file
    -- In the script field, you can define commands to run complex scripts
    -- Ex: "scripts": { 
                "test": "./node_modules/.bin/mocha test/*.js"
            }

            run with: "npm test" or "npm test -- test/*.js" 

--> What if yout build requirements have more steps, and include things like copying, concatenating,
or moving files? Many build systems provide Javascript APIs for automating builds: Gulp is the solution.

=== GULP ===
    --> It's a build system based on streams.
    --> Gulp's API has methods for things like finding files and piping them throug plugins that transform them in some way.
    --> Tasks usually follow the same pattern (STCO)
        - Source:    Gather input files
        - Transpile: Pipe them through a plugin that transforms them
        - Concat:    Pipe the files together to create a monolithic build 
        - Output:    Set a file destination or move the output files
    --> Gulp can be used to write more­complex tasks with JavaScript and is cross­­ platform.

=== Webapck ===
    --> Especifically designed to build web applications.
    --> It's easier to quickly set up a build system that supports incremental builds.
    --> webpack terminology:
        -- Plugins are used to change the behavior of the build process. Instances of classes.
        -- Loaders are transformations that are applied to resource files.

=== Loading CommonJS modules and assets ===
